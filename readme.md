## Getting Started

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

Then you will have to start both Angular and Vue webservers (so open a new Terminal session for each of those commands):

```bash
yarn start
cd ng-src && yarn serve
cd vue-src && yarn serve
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3333. Enjoy!
